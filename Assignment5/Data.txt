Data science is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting large volumes of data to uncover patterns and make informed decisions. It combines techniques from statistics, machine learning, and programming to extract meaningful insights. Using tools like Python, R, SQL, and cloud computing, data scientists work with structured and unstructured data across various industries, including healthcare, finance, and marketing. Key concepts in data science include data preprocessing, predictive modeling, and artificial intelligence. As organizations increasingly rely on data-driven strategies, the demand for skilled data scientists continues to grow, making it a vital field for innovation and problem-solving.
